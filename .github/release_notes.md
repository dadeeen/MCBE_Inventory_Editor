Runtime package for the Minecraft Bedrock Inventory Editor.

## What changed in v0.5.16

- Item DB and vanilla-icon update output now follows the language selected in the app. English sessions no longer receive a mixture of English and German progress messages, diff summaries, cache status, and result counts.
- The vanilla-icon section heading is localized as well, and direct updater CLI help follows the forwarded updater language.
- The localization catalog check now covers both updater scripts, preventing new updater messages from silently shipping without an English translation.
- Item DB schema v3, the availability schema, item classifications, and the underlying Mojang data remain unchanged in this patch release.

> **If upgrading directly from v0.5.14 or earlier:** the Item DB may show **Verification pending** even when its data has not changed. This is expected because the verification rules changed in v0.5.15; it does not mean that the database is damaged. If the setup dialog opens, select **Load now** for **Load item database**. Otherwise, open **Tools & settings → Item DB**, run a dry run, and then select **Apply update**. An apply with no data changes only refreshes the local verification record.

> **Before every edit:** stop Minecraft or the Bedrock server and create a complete, independent copy of the world. Keep that copy until the edited world has been verified in Minecraft. App-created backups are an additional safeguard, not a replacement.
